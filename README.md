Artwork for Commonhaus Foundation and hosted projects 

## About this artwork

This repo hosts artwork for the [Commonhaus Foundation](https://www.commonhaus.org) and its hosted projects. Before you use this artwork, please be aware that it is subject to the [Trademark Policy](http://www.commonhaus.org/policies/trademark-policy/) of the Commonhaus Foundation.

You should take the time to read and understand the [Trademark Policy](http://www.commonhaus.org/policies/trademark-policy/), as it will help you to understand the situations in which you can use the marks without asking, and when you need to ask for permission.

At a high level, these marks have been created to refer to open source projects and organizations. The [Trademark Policy](http://www.commonhaus.org/policies/trademark-policy/) is designed to strike a balance between enabling project communities to use them and protecting their value. For a list of marks covered by the Trademark Policy, please see the [Trademark List](https://www.commonhaus.org/trademarks/).

Finally, we recognize that project artwork may change over time, and many projects maintain their artwork in their source repos. The goal of this repo is to mirror those assets in a single place. If you have a vector version of your project's artwork (.svg, .eps, .ai), please submit a PR to add it to the gallery.

If you're building or managing a website for an Commonhaus Foundation-hosted project, please see our guidance on the [proper text to use in website footers](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/blob/main/templates/website-footer.md).

## Preparing artwork for contribution

If you plan to contribute artwork, please help us keep things consistent and organized by following these basic guidelines:

- Plain `.svg` is the preferred file format. Please start with this. We can help you convert `.ai`, `.eps`, or (in some cases) `.pdf` files.
- `.png` is preferred for non-vector images. We can help you convert your `.svg` to `.png` if need be. Please scale it to 500px in one dimension, at minimum.
- To the greatest extent possible, please try to trim whitespace around the image.

Please follow this naming convention: `project_name/project_name-type-orientation-color-background.filetype`

- `project_name`: lower case, convert spaces to underscores
- `type`: `icon` or `logo`, where the logo generally includes the icon and some text.
- `orientation`: for logos, `horizontal` or `stacked`
- `color`: the color of the image itself, e.g., `color`, `black`, `white`, `grayscale`
- `background`: optional, use `dark_background` for images with a color icon and white text

Pull requests welcomed!
