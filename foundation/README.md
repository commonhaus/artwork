## Project Specific Commonhaus Foundation artwork

We have prepared Commonhaus Foundation logos with interlocking "foo is a Commonhaus Foundation Project" taglines for use by Foundaton member projects to use in their site and promotions.

- Project specific logo files can be found in the [Project](brand/project) artwork subfolder
- The minimum spacing (as defined in the [Branding guidelines](https://www.commonhaus.org/about/branding.html) is built into the files.
- All other branding guidelines for the Commonhaus Foundation logo must be followed.
- When using the interlock logos, it's highly suggested to include the alt tag of "< ProjectName > is a Commonhaus Foundation Project".
