# Logo Assets

There are two alignments of the logo (vertical and horizontal) for use depending on your space requirements.

> **Background Color** Notice there are multiple versions of logo coloring for use on different background colors (light and dark options). The "default" logo is for use on a light background while the "reverse" logo is for use on dark backgrounds. The one-color versions are designed for use when you have to present it monochromatically.
